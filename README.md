# üß† Automated Essay Scoring (AES)

Automated Essay Scoring (AES) is the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to automatically assign scores to written essays. This project explores two approaches to AES:
- Traditional Machine Learning (`AES_ML.ipynb`)
- Neural Networks (`AES_NN.ipynb`)

## üöÄ Features

- Preprocessing of essay text (tokenization, lemmatization, etc.)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF and word embeddings
- Essay scoring using:
  - Machine Learning models: Random Forest, SVM, etc.
  - Neural Network models: Dense layers, activation functions, etc.
- Evaluation using metrics like RMSE

## üìÅ Dataset

The project uses the **ASAP dataset** (from Kaggle or other sources), which includes:
- Essay ID
- Essay text
- Human-assigned scores

> **Note**: Dataset not included in the repository due to size/license. You can download it from [Kaggle AES Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/asap-aes).
